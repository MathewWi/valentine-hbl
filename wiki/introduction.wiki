==What is HB Loader? ==

HB Loader is a project to build an easy to port user-mode homebrew loader for the Sony PSP console.

==Why HB Loader?==

To allow users with yet unhackable PSPs to experience the homebrew scene.

==Does this allow me to downgrade?==

No, will never be.

==Does whis allow full HEN/CFW?==

No, will never be.

==Does this allow kernel access?==

No, will never be.

==Does this load ISO/CSO?==

No, doubt will ever be.

==Does this allow me to use emulators?==

Most emulators work!

==Then what homebrews do work?==

We're having tests for this here: http://wololo.net/talk/viewforum.php?f=11

==How about PS1 games?==

PS1 games use a very different mechanism and we have no plan to work on this for now.

==Is this useful for a normal PSP user?==

Some users already enjoy it, but the work is not finished yet.

==What's the project current status?==

It's still a BETA, but the developers are working on it ;) You can check the current issues: http://code.google.com/p/valentine-hbl/issues/list. Also check the HBL development subforum: hhttp://wololo.net/talk/viewforum.php?f=4 for more information/help on developing. 

==When this will be completed?==

No timing schedule for now.

==When this will be useful for normal users?==

It is already ;)

==What is need to be done to finish it?==

See the ==What's the project current status?== question.

2. If you're a developer but find hard to understand HBL source, contact the active developers so they can help you understand it

3. Help with development-related tasks: http://wololo.net/talk/viewforum.php?f=4

4. Try homebrews with HBL and report if they work or not. Please attach as much information on the homebrew as possible: http://wololo.net/talk/viewforum.php?f=11

Check the HBL forum: http://wololo.net/talk/viewforum.php?f=3

==Can I make modifications/use the source code for myself?==

Yes you can, in fact it's your right. But you MUST also make the source with the changes you did available for everyone to download. You cannot distribute only the binaries.

==How can I install this?==

Go to the forums ;) http://wololo.net/talk/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=204
